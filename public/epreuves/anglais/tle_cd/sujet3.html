                        <p>The youth represent the future of our nation - those who have transitioned from childhood but have not yet reached full adulthood. Digital innovation refers to the creative use of technology to solve problems and improve lives. When we talk about national development, we mean the progress of our country in economic, social, and technological aspects.</p>
                        
                        <p>By embracing technology responsibly, by developing digital skills, and by using these skills to address local challenges, we contribute to our nation's growth. [...]</p>
                        
                        <p>Digital literacy and national development are therefore crucial areas where we must focus our efforts to help achieve Cameroon's Vision 2035. [...]</p>
