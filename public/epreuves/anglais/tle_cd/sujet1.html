Thomas set a <input type="text" class="form-control" style="width: 100px;"> <strong>6</strong> to work a new job each week for a year. That's 52 occupations in one year. And he did it! One week, as a dairy <input type="text" class="form-control" style="width: 100px;"> <strong>7</strong>, he milked cows every morning. Then, in another week, he was an <input type="text" class="form-control" style="width: 140px;"> <strong>8</strong> studying the night sky. Thomas's favorite job, though, was teaching. He learned he was happiest when he was <input type="text" class="form-control" style="width: 100px;"> <strong>9</strong> others. Thomas also learned it's ok to not know what you want to do right away. He wrote a book about his <input type="text" class="form-control" style="width: 120px;"> <strong>10</strong> and today he tells his story to college students. His message? You'll find your perfect job one day. After all, Thomas found his.

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        These days, people who perform manual labor often receive far more money than clerks who work in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as "white-collar workers" for the simple reason that they usually wear a shirt and tie to go to work. Such is human nature that a great number of people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs, who worked as a garbage collector for a Municipal Corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                        When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the corporation. Every morning, he left home dressed in a fine black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a garbage collector. Before returning home at night, he took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alf did this for two years and his fellow workers kept his secret. Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a garbage collector and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office as a junior clerk. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him "Mr. Bloggs", not "Alf".
