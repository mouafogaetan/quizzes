                    <p><strong>THE BENEFITS OF A HOBBY</strong></p>
                    <p>Sarah (not her real name) is a young fashion designer who draws inspiration from traditional West African fabrics and clothing, as well as from the fashions of London. She has created a label that produces modern interpretations of the "kaba", which is the traditional garment from Cameroon's littoral region.</p>
                    <p>For Sarah, this whole adventure started as a hobby. She says; "I have been nurturing my dream, which started as a hobby, for a long time. I always saw my love for designing as a hobby, and it never occurred to me that it could be a career. Indeed, no one in my family would have considered this as a suitable career for a well-educated girl from a respectable family! As expected by my family, I studied at university and successfully graduated with two degrees.</p>
                    <p>"But while I was studying, I was expanding my skills in design and dressmaking and exploring my passion for fashion. Then one day, while I was at work, things changed for me. I was wearing one of my own dresses, made from hand-woven fabric. A customer approached me and asked where she could buy a dress like mine, and then she ordered one. My hobby was about to become a career!"</p>
                    
                    <p class="instruction">Answer the following questions.</p>

                        <p>a) What is Sarah's job? <input type="text" placeholder="Answer"> (2 points)</p>
