            <div class="text-justify">
                <p><strong>Text:</strong></p>
                <p>Same-gender attraction refers to romantic or sexual feelings between individuals of the same sex. This can apply to both men and women. Women who experience these attractions are often called lesbians, while men are frequently referred to as gay.</p>
                
                <p>Research suggests that various factors may contribute to same-gender attraction, including biological, environmental, and psychological elements. For example, some studies indicate that individuals who have limited opportunities to form relationships with the opposite sex might develop attractions to same-gender individuals. This phenomenon is sometimes observed in single-gender environments such as boarding schools or certain occupational settings.</p>
                
                <p>Contemporary society continues to evolve in its understanding and acceptance of diverse sexual orientations. While some view this evolution as progress toward greater inclusivity, others express concerns about rapid social changes. There are ongoing debates about the balance between individual rights and traditional values across different cultures and communities.</p>
                
                <p>In recent decades, many countries have witnessed significant changes in legislation and social attitudes regarding same-gender relationships. These developments have sparked discussions about the nature of personal freedom, the role of tradition, and the definition of family in modern societies.</p>
