        <h5 class="section-title mt-5">Part Two: Assessment of Competence (20 marks)</h5>

        <h6 class="mt-4">Section C: Reading Comprehension (10 marks)</h6>
        
        <p><strong>Task:</strong> Read the following passage and answer the questions</p>
        
        <div class="border p-3 bg-light">
            <p>In many African nations today, ethnic favoritism has become a dominant force in national conversations, influencing how people think and communicate, and determining what they oppose or support. This phenomenon is often promoted by political elites, embraced by both young and old, transmitted across generations, and sometimes even finds basis in constitutional frameworks.</p>
            
            <p>This reality explains the common assumption that conflicts in these nations are driven by ethnic rivalry. Citizens must ask themselves: "How did we reach this point? What and who bears responsibility? Why do other countries with similar diversity not obsess over their differences to the same extent?" In many cases, ethnic diversity has become more of a threat than a source of national pride and development, unlike experiences in some other nations.</p>
            
            <p>Ethnic considerations have played significant roles in politics since the pre-independence era and are arguably among the important causes of conflict and overall obstacles to economic progress. Unfortunately, the foundation of party politics in many countries has been ethnically oriented, as evidenced in various republics.</p>
            
            <p>Some consequences of ethnic favoritism include:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Difficulty combating corruption:</strong> There exists a tradition that discourages citizens from exposing or prosecuting fellow ethnic members for corrupt practices. Corrupt behaviors are displayed and laws broken, yet such individuals invoke ethnic solidarity to avoid accountability.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Employment and contract bias:</strong> Securing employment or public contracts often depends on having someone from your ethnic group in authority. The phrase "it's our turn" originated from this practice. Merit and excellence are sacrificed at the altar of primordial thinking.</p>
            
            <p>A fundamental impact of tribalism is a culture of distrust among various ethnic groups. Due to this distrust, legitimate concerns about poverty and environmental issues in certain regions are dismissed as merely "ethnic problems."</p>
            
            <p>Ethnic favoritism thrives mainly because it serves as an effective tool providing advantage in the perpetual struggle for political appointments. After securing positions, tribal sentiments are again used as protection to misuse office and evade justice after leaving power.</p>
            
            <p>Those proposing radical solutions often fail to see their country as a unified nation. Through this narrow perspective, they disregard the integration already achieved between different ethnic groups through intermarriage, shared religion, commerce, and internal migration.</p>
            
            <p>Another perspective suggests that people's behavior and attitudes must be transformed rather than dividing along ethnic lines. There remain regions advocating for autonomy based on ethnicity. This viewpoint argues that solutions to conflicts and desires for mono-ethnic territories lie in good governance, justice, and equal opportunity regardless of ethnicity. This school of thought maintains that corruption and tyranny are individual traits, not ethnic characteristics, advocating for systems addressing problematic behaviors rather than targeting ethnic origins.</p>
